/**
 * Business logic exception for handling domain-specific errors, business rule violations, and
 * validation failures.
 *
 * This exception class extends [ApplicationException] to provide specialized handling for
 * business-related errors including domain rule violations, business validation failures, workflow
 * errors, and business process exceptions. It maintains all the validation and error handling
 * capabilities of the base class while providing business-specific context.
 *
 * Common use cases include:
 * - Business rule violations (insufficient funds, invalid state transitions, policy violations)
 * - Domain validation failures (invalid business data, constraint violations, referential
 *   integrity)
 * - Workflow errors (process step failures, approval violations, sequence errors)
 * - Business process exceptions (order processing failures, payment errors, inventory issues)
 * - Data integrity violations (duplicate records, missing required relationships)
 *
 * @param httpStatus The HTTP status code associated with this business exception. Must be an error
 *   status (4xx or 5xx). Common business-related status codes include 400 (Bad Request), 409
 *   (Conflict), 422 (Unprocessable Entity), and 412 (Precondition Failed).
 * @param status The status information providing additional context about the business error state.
 *   Cannot be Status.SUCCESS since this represents a business failure.
 * @param error The structured error details containing specific information about the business
 *   violation.
 * @param message A human-readable description of the business exception. This value cannot be
 *   blank.
 * @param cause The underlying cause of this business exception, or null if there is no underlying
 *   cause. Useful for chaining business-related exceptions and preserving domain error context.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if httpStatus is not an error status (not 4xx or 5xx)
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if message is blank or empty
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if status is Status.SUCCESS
 * @see ApplicationException
 * @see Status
 * @see Error

/**
 * Base application exception class for handling HTTP-related errors with structured error
 * information.
 *
 * This exception class provides a standardized way to represent errors that occur within the
 * application, including HTTP status codes, structured error details, and status information. It
 * extends the standard [Exception] class while adding validation constraints to ensure proper error
 * handling.
 *
 * @param httpStatus The HTTP status code associated with this exception. Must be between 400 and
 *   599 (inclusive) to represent client and server error status codes according to HTTP
 *   specifications.
 * @param status The status information providing additional context about the error state. Cannot
 *   be Status.SUCCESS since this is an exception class for error conditions only.
 * @param error The structured error details containing specific information about what went wrong.
 * @param message A human-readable description of the exception. This value cannot be blank and will
 *   be used as the exception message.
 * @param cause The underlying cause of this exception, or null if there is no underlying cause.
 *   This can be used to chain exceptions and preserve the original error context.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if httpStatus is not within the valid range (400-599)
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if message is blank or empty
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if status is Status.SUCCESS
 * @see Exception
 * @see Status
 * @see Error

/**
 * Security-related exception for handling authentication, authorization, and access control errors.
 *
 * This exception class extends [ApplicationException] to provide specialized handling for
 * security-related errors including authentication failures, authorization violations, access
 * control breaches, and security policy violations. It maintains all the validation and error
 * handling capabilities of the base class while providing security-specific context.
 *
 * Common use cases include:
 * - Authentication failures (invalid credentials, expired tokens)
 * - Authorization violations (insufficient permissions, access denied)
 * - Security policy violations (password complexity, account lockout)
 * - Access control breaches (unauthorized resource access)
 *
 * @param httpStatus The HTTP status code associated with this security exception. Must be an error
 *   status (4xx or 5xx). Common security-related status codes include 401 (Unauthorized), 403
 *   (Forbidden), and 429 (Too Many Requests).
 * @param status The status information providing additional context about the security error state.
 *   Cannot be Status.SUCCESS since this represents a security failure.
 * @param error The structured error details containing specific information about the security
 *   violation.
 * @param message A human-readable description of the security exception. This value cannot be
 *   blank.
 * @param cause The underlying cause of this security exception, or null if there is no underlying
 *   cause. Useful for chaining security-related exceptions and preserving error context.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if httpStatus is not an error status (not 4xx or 5xx)
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if message is blank or empty
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if status is Status.SUCCESS
 * @see ApplicationException
 * @see Status
